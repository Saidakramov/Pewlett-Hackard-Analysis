  - Data suggests that there are only 1,549 employees eligible to mentor.
  - We can see that only 569 Senior Staff, 501 Engineers, and 106 Senior Engineers are eligible for the mentorship. 

## Summary:

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

  - We know that 72,458 employees are retiring, and only 1,549 employees within the company could be eligible for a mentorship program. Pewlett Hackard will need to fill 25,916 roles for the Senior Engineer position, 24,926 roles for the Senior Staff position, 9,285 roles for an Engineer position, 7,636 roles for a Staff position, 3,603 roles for Technique Leader position, 1,090 roles for the Assistant Engineer postion and only two roles for Manager position.


- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

  - Altogether, Pewlett Hackard has 1,549 retirement-ready employees to mentor next-generation employees. They consist of employees holding the following positions: 569 Senior Staff, 501 Engineer, 169 Senior Engineer, 155 Staff, 78 Assistant Engineer, and 77 Technique Leader. We notice that no employees are available to mentor an upcoming two Manager titles. Also, it is noticeable that amount of mentors is highly disproportionate to the number of trainees. Each Senior Engineer will have to mentor 153-154 future Senior Engineers, each Senior Staff will have to mentor 43-44 future employees, each Engineer needs to mentor 18-19 employees, each Staff needs to mentor 49-50 future Staff, and each Technique Leader must mentor 46-47 prospective candidates, and each Assistant Engineer needs to mentor 13-14 future Assistant Engineers. 
  - We can conclude that there are not enough qualified retirement-ready employees to mentor future candidates for Pewlett Hackard.
